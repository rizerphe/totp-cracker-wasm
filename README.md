# TOTP Cracker :3

![LICENSE:MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This is the webassembly backend for TOTP Cracker :3 - a proof-of-concept TOTP cracker inspired by [this tweet](https://x.com/miaaowing/status/1810426439792984165). The google authenticator migration protocol implementation is _heavily inspired (wink wink)_ by [a python implementation of the same thing](https://github.com/qistoph/otp_export).
